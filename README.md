# Ubunterransiblernetes

A CI/CD pipeline project utilizing Terraform, Jenkins, Ansible Playbook, Docker, Microk8s, and AWS EC2.
- Terraform automatically provision AWS EC2 instances
- Terraform executes Ansible Playbook scripts that configure and set up dockerized Jenkins within the created instances.

## Deployment Architecture

## Install Terraform and Ansible in Local Machine

Local machine runs on Lubuntu OS.

1. [Terraform Installation in Ubuntu](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/install/apt.html#repository-configuration)
2. [Ansible Installation in Ubuntu](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-ubuntu)

## Use Terraform to provision AWS infrastructure 

The following components are created using Terraform. See `main.tf` file.

1. VPC
2. Internet gateway
3. Route table
4. Subnet
5. Route table association
6. Security group
7. Network interface
8. An EC2 instance with the resources above associated, using Ubuntu 20.04

## Use Ansible Playbook to automate EC2 instance configuration

Ansible Playbook is used to automate configuration and installation of the following within the provisioned EC2 instance:

1. Git
2. Docker
3. Jenkins
4. Microk8s

The lines starting from `provisioner "remote-exec"{...` in `main.tf` shows the associated code for incorporating Ansible Playbook within Terraform. See `main.yaml` for the Ansible Playbook file that is used for this task.

The `main.yaml` playbook tasks are broken into several roles that are contained within the `roles` directory.

#### Configure Jenkins - Plugins

The following Jenkins plugins are used:

1. [Git](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git/)
2. [GitHub](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git/)
3. [Docker](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-plugin/)
4. [Docker Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-workflow/)
5. [Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator/)
## Jenkins Job Configuration: Pipeline

Choose the Pipeline job.

On `Pipeline` configuration, provide the repository URL. If using GitHub, don't forget to change Branch Specifier from `*/master` to `*/main`.

## Jenkins Automate Build and Push Image to DockerHub

1. Create a new repository in DockerHub
2. Go to Jenkins Configuration -> Manage Credentials -> `(global)`

4. See `Jenkinsfile` for pipeline setup

## Incorporate Jenkins with GitHub
[Reference](https://www.cprime.com/resources/blog/how-to-integrate-jenkins-github/)

Go to the GitHub project that will be used in the pipeline. Go to Settings -> Webhooks -> Add webhook.

![](https://github.com/ronaldyonggi/2020_03_DO_Boston_casestudy_part_1/blob/main/screenshots/webhook.jpg)


Set the Payload URL to be the Jenkins URL with `/github-webhook/`added at the end. Then change content type to `application/json`.
